# Spelling Corrector

The original [spell.py](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/py/spell.py) by Peter Norwig was translated to Go by [Yi Wang](https://code.google.com/archive/p/spell-correct-in-go/).

This Go version is a tweak of Yi Wang's version to meet our coding standards.

Please feel free to comment or suggest improvements by opening an issue for discussion. Will be good to see if we can together enhance the original program.
